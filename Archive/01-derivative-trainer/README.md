# Derivative Trainer with GeoGebra

This project is an interactive tool designed to master the rules of differentiation. It combines a **random problem generator** with **real-time graphical feedback**, allowing users to practice calculating derivatives while visualizing the relationship between a function and its slope.

**Access the tool here:** [Derivative Trainer on GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/m/gg39mzux)  
> **Tip:** For the best experience, click the three dots in the top right and select **"Open in App"**. This allows you to resize the windows and ensures the input boxes and graphs are displayed clearly.

## 📖 Overview

Mastering derivatives requires moving beyond memorization toward active practice. This applet provides a structured environment to train your skills using two main windows:

1.  **Control & Training Panel (Left):** This is where you interact with the algebra. You can input custom functions, generate random challenges based on specific rules, and verify your solutions.
2.  **Visualization Deck (Right):** This window provides the geometric context. It allows you to toggle the graphs of the function and its derivative to see how symbolic changes affect the geometry of the curve.

## 🛠 Key Features

* **Customizable Random Generator:** Generate endless problems by choosing the types of functions you want to practice (Polynomials, Trig, Exp, Log, etc.).
* **Difficulty Scaling:** Adjust the difficulty level to move from basic functions to more complex expressions involving products, quotients, compositions, etc.
* **Instant Verification:**
    * **Check Box:** Type your answer and use the **Check Answer** button to see if it is correct.
    * **Show Answer:** If you are stuck, you can reveal the correct derivative to compare with your work.
* **Visual Intuition:** Use the checkboxes to show the graph of $f(x)$ and $f'(x)$. This helps you visualize how the "zeros" of the derivative correspond to the "peaks and valleys" of the original function.
**Note:** For longer expressions it might be needed to move the **derivative solution** textbox to see the full answer, as it might not fit in the window.

## 🔬 Mathematical Context

The derivative $f'(x)$ represents the **instantaneous rate of change** of a function. Being able to find the correct derivative of a function is fundamental for physics, mathematics and many other disciplines, but getting the hang of it can be challenging at first and requires a lot of practice. With this applet you can generate as many practice problems as you want, whether you are a teacher or a student.

The function generator combines the chosen function types by randomly multiplying, adding, subtracting, dividing, composing or exponentiating them to generate a good practice problem.

## 📂 Project Documentation

Included in this repository is a detailed technical guide:
* **[Derivative_Trainer_Guide.pdf](./Derivative_Trainer_Guide.pdf)**

The PDF covers a review of differentiation rules, common pitfalls for students, and a full user manual for the GeoGebra applet's generator settings.

This is part of an ongoing project for the YouTube channel [Sandrodmun](https://www.youtube.com/@sandrodmun) where we study many different subjects in mathematics, physics, etc., rigorously with precise definitions and proofs, and interactively, with apps and games like the ones in this repository that will make the concepts easier to grasp.

The project is ambitious and far-reaching so it will take some time until I can upload the full courses to the YouTube channel, but I will try to upload part of the full courses soon!
