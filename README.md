# Interactive Mathematics Visualizations

Welcome! I'm **Sandro Rodríguez Muñoz**, a Physics/Mathematics graduate student passionate about making abstract concepts tangible through interactive visualizations. This is my collection of **GeoGebra projects** exploring various subjects that I have been doing as a hobby, for tutoring classes, and also for my YouTube channel.

## About This Portfolio

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Physics and an MSc in pure Mathematics, and have always liked making interactive projects and apps to visualize and explain concepts in Physics and Mathematics more visually.

After some time trying to do animations and apps using Python and Javascript, I've chosen **GeoGebra** as the main platform because it allows anyone to immediately engage with these visualizations, no downloads, no installations, just click and explore.

In my YouTube channel [Sandrodmun](https://www.youtube.com/@sandrodmun) I have been uploading videos explaining concepts and doing exercises that I found interesting while finishing my Bachelor's but some time ago I decided to make more structured and formal courses on many subjects, that is why there is a big time gap since my last video, I am in the process of preparing the resoruces, notes, structure, etc. for all of these courses, like the resources in this repository.

These are some of the projects I have been doing, trying to capture the main ideas of how I view the project I have in mind.

## Featured Projects (4)

These are some of the projects that I consider to be finished. They will in the future be incorporated into more complete and rigorous courses on Complex Analysis, Abstract Algebra, Calculus, etc.

### 1. [Visualization of Complex Functions](./FEATURED_PROJECTS/01-complex-functions/)
**A nice way of Visualizing how Complex Functions Work**
- Explore different complex functions and how they transform horizontal and vertical lines
- Define any parametric path and see how $f$ transforms it completely
- See how $f$ behaves when we approach a pole

### 2. [Visualization of the Gradient and the Laplacian](./FEATURED_PROJECTS/02-gradient-laplacian/)
**Understand multivariable calculus through interactive geometry.**
- See how the gradient vector field points in the direction of steepest ascent
- Explore the Laplacian operator and how it tells us about peaks and valleys

### 3. [Graph Isomorphisms Through a Game](./FEATURED_PROJECTS/03-graph-isomorphisms-game/)
**Learn graph theory by playing an interactive game.**
- Determine if two graphs are isomorphic by finding the correct vertex mapping
- Build intuition about graph structure with a game
- Progressive difficulty levels

### 4. [Visualization of Change of Basis in ℝ² & Basis Change Calculator](./FEATURED_PROJECTS/05-change-of-basis/)
**Master linear algebra transformations visually.**
- Interactive visualization of basis transformations
- See how coordinates change under different bases
- Built-in calculator for basis change computations

## Ideas for Future Projects

I have many more ideas in mind! Some I'm currently exploring:
- Simulations of important experiments in Physics
- Special Relativity
- Fourier series visualizations
- Topology concepts (continuous deformations, homeomorphisms)
- Vector calculus (curl, divergence, line integrals)
- Non-Euclidean geometry visualizations
- Dynamical systems and chaos theory
- Isomorphisms of structures like groups, rings, vector spaces, etc.
- Free constructions like free groups, free vector spaces, etc.
- Category Theory explanations like pullbacks, pushforwards, morphisms, natural transformations, etc.
- And more...
