# Interactive Mathematics Visualizations

Welcome! I'm **Sandro Rodríguez Muñoz**, a mathematician passionate about making abstract concepts tangible through interactive visualizations. This is my collection of **GeoGebra projects** exploring complex analysis, differential geometry, graph theory, celestial mechanics, and linear algebra.

## About This Portfolio

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Physics and an MSc in Pure Mathematics. As an educator and content creator (YouTube channel on mathematics and physics), I believe that **interactive visualization** is one of the most powerful tools for understanding mathematics. 

Rather than building standalone apps, I've chosen **GeoGebra** as my platform because it allows anyone to immediately engage with these visualizations—no downloads, no installations, just click and explore.

**Currently applying to:** [Brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org) 🚀
